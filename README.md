# Modern-FLU-Epidemic-Project

**Problem**

A modern flu is spread throughout a small community with a fixed population of size n. The disease is spread through contact between infected persons and persons who are susceptible to the disease. Assume that everyone is susceptible to the disease initially and that the community is contained so that no one leaves the community. Suppose b = 0.002, a = 0.7, and n = 1000.
Solve the system for the following initial conditions: I(0) = 2, 5, 10, and 100.
Using I(0) = 2, 5, 10, and 100 and S(0) = n-I(0), resolve the system and interpret the result.

**Project Description**

We plan to investigate the spread patterns of this disease using a SIR model - the most practical model to adapt when dealing with an epidemic. Our model will show the relationship between susceptible, infected, and recovered individuals, noting a fixed population of n=1000, transmission rate of b=0.002, and a recovery rate of a=0.7. We will solve the system of differential equations that define the spread of this modern flu for different initial infection levels: I(0)=2, 5, 10, and 100, and then analyze the behavior of each curve over time. By analyzing each curveâ€™s behavior, we are going to be looking at the most people infected by the disease at once, when that peak occurred, the duration of the flu outbreak, and the total number of people who recovered. Lastly, we will validate our results using real world data about flu outbreaks, and the recovery and transmission rates associated with them.
